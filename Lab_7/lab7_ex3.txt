Exercise 3:

1) Create zero padding around image and make sure image is on the complete top left side of the padding

2) Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the Fourier coefficients F

3) Shift the low frequency components to the center

4) Generate filter function H. It depends on which filter you will be using, so generate accordingly

5) Multiply filter function H with Fourier coefficients F to obtain the filtered Fourier coefficients G

6) Transform the filtered Fourier coefficients back to the spatial domain

7) Remove imaginary components and values exceeded the range of 0 to 255
